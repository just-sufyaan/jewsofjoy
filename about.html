      <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
      <!-- A paragraph describing the origin and vision of the company -->
      <p>
        Founded with a vision of elegance and craftsmanship, Jewels of Joy began
        as a small project fueled by passion for creating beautiful jewelry. What started as a humble dream has grown into a beloved brand known for its quality and attention to detail. Each piece we create is designed with love and made to last, reflecting our commitment to excellence.
      </p>
      <!-- A paragraph about the founder and their belief about jewelry -->
      <p>
        Our founder <strong>Isabella Hart</strong> believes jewelry is more than
        just something to wear â€” it's a reflection of style and memory, a way to celebrate life's most precious moments and express individual personality. This philosophy guides everything we do, from design to customer service.
